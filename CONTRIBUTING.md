# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement.
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch against the version branch for which your fix is intended.

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch. This allows each feature or improvement to be reviewed and merged individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must be without linting errors, and must follow [convention commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Testing

All pull requests must be accompanied by passing adequate amount of tests and complete code coverage.
